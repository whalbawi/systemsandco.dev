title:  "Guide: C++ Instrumentation with Memory Sanitizer"
tags: sanitizers MSan C++
---

## Introduction
The LLVM project provides a collection of dynamic analyzers called [sanitizers] to detect - at
runtime - various correctness issues in applications. For example, Thread Sanitizer (TSan) detects
data races while Memory Sanitizer (MSan) detects uninitialized memory usage. Using these tools
typically requires compiling and linking the binary to be analyzed with special flags. For example,
a C++ application is usually instrumented with TSan as follows,
```sh
$ clang++ -O0 -g -fsanitize=thread racy.cpp
```

To reduce false positives, all dependencies of an application must also be built with the
appropriate flags. Instrumenting a C++ application with MSan is particularly challenging because
this requirement extends to the standard C++ library itself . LLVM recommends using their own
implementation of the standard library, `libc++`.

This guide will demonstrate how to correctly build `libc++` and `libc++abi` from source and then use
them to instrument your application. The code samples in this post are further developed
[here][code-samples] for usage in a CMake-based project.

## Motivating Example: False Positives
Suppose we'd like to check the following application for memory usage errors:
```c++
 1 #include <set>
 2
 3 int main() {
 4     std::set<int> magic_numbers;
 5     int a;
 6
 7     if (a > 5) {
 8         magic_numbers.insert(a);
 9     }
10
11     return 0;
12 }
```

We expect MSan to complain about the `if` statement on line 7 because it reads from the
uninitialized variable `a`.  Let's build the application with MSan instrumentation and see
what happens:
```sh
$ clang++ -O0 -g -fsanitize=memory -fsanitize-recover=memory -o umr umr.cpp
```
Upon running `umr`, MSan reports the expected error on line 7:
```

SUMMARY: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value /workspace/umr.cpp:7:9 in main
```
However, it also reports two additional errors stemming from the `std::set` destructor:

SUMMARY: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value /workspace/umr.cpp:12:1 in main
MemorySanitizer: 3 warnings reported.
```

Unless there is a bug in GCC's standard C++ library, these two warnings are false positives. They
occur because that library is not instrumented, so MSan loses track of memory state internal to it.
To eliminate them, we must build and link against an MSan-instrumented version of `libc++`.

Note that we compiled the application with `-O0` to eliminate any compiler optimization and ensure
all code is executed. On my system, `clang` will elide line 8 when the code is compiled with `-O1`.
Using `-O2` or higher, the whole application is optimized out so MSan reports nothing.

## Building an Instrumented `libc++`
Ensure you have `cmake`, `clang` and `make` installed.
Instrumenting `libc++` means building it from source with the appropriate flags using CMake,
which is LLVM's supported build system. The recommended compiler for this task is `clang` whose
version must be "close enough" to that of `libc++`. We'll be using version 18.1.3.
```sh
$ clang --version
Ubuntu clang version 18.1.3 (1ubuntu1)
Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin
```

Let's clone LLVM 18.1.3:
```sh
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git -b llvmorg-18.1.3
```

We'll start by configuring our build system and then build `libc++` and `libc++abi`. The crucial
CMake option is `-DLLVM_USE_SANITIZER=MemoryWithOrigins`. We're building a `Debug` version for
better error messages. We'll stick to `libunwind` for backtraces instead of using LLVM's unwinder.
Lastly, we'll install the built libraries at a known location `/usr/libcxx-msan` for ease of
integration with our code:
```sh
$ cmake \
      -S llvm-project/runtimes \
      -B build \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/libcxx-msan \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi" \
      -DLLVM_USE_SANITIZER=MemoryWithOrigins \
      -DLIBCXXABI_USE_LLVM_UNWINDER=OFF \
      -DLIBCXX_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \
      -DLIBCXX_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF
```
Once done, CMake will output something like:
```
-- Configuring done (5.7s)
-- Generating done (0.0s)
-- Build files have been written to: /workspace/build
```

Now build the libraries:
```sh
$ cmake --build build -j $(nproc) --target cxx cxxabi
```

CMake will output the build's progress:
```
[  0%] Copying CXXABI header cxxabi.h
[  0%] Copying CXXABI header __cxxabi_config.h
...
[100%] Built target cxxabi_shared
[100%] Built target cxxabi
```

Now install the instrumented libraries:
```sh
$ sudo cmake --build build -j $(nproc) --target install-cxx install-cxxabi
```

Upon success, CMake will show where it installed the libraries:
```
[  0%] Built target generate-cxxabi-headers
[ 87%] Built target generate-cxx-headers
-- Install configuration: "Debug"
-- Installing: /usr/libcxx-msan/include/c++/v1/__algorithm/adjacent_find.h
-- Installing: /usr/libcxx-msan/include/c++/v1/__algorithm/all_of.h
...
-- Installing: /usr/libcxx-msan/lib/libc++abi.so
-- Installing: /usr/libcxx-msan/lib/libc++abi.a
[100%] Built target install-cxxabi
```

## Instrumenting the Application

It's now time to compile and link the sample application against the instrumented `libc++` we just
built. The compilation and linking step can be combined but are shown below separately for clarity.

We tell `clang` to not use the system-wide standard C++ library headers and instead use the one
we built earlier. We'll also ask MSan to track allocations using `-fsanitize-memory-track-origins`
so that we know the origin of uninitialized reads.
```sh
$ clang++ \
      -O0 \
      -g \
      -nostdinc++ \
      -I /usr/libcxx-msan/include/c++/v1 \
      -fsanitize=memory \
      -fsanitize-recover=memory \
      -fsanitize-memory-track-origins \
      -c umr.cpp
```

When linking the binary, we tell `clang` to not use the system-wide standard C++ library and instead
use the ones we built. We will opt for static linking to avoid dealing with non-standard library
paths:
```sh
$ clang++ \
      -nostdlib++ \
      -fsanitize=memory \
      -o umr \
      umr.o \
      /usr/libcxx-msan/lib/libc++.a \
      /usr/libcxx-msan/lib/libc++abi.a
```

Now let's run `umr`. As expected, we have a single warning reported and we're told where the
variable involved in the uninitialized read is allocated.
```
==1854756==WARNING: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value
    #0 0x58f66bc21511 in main /workspace/umr.cpp:7:9
    #1 0x7ae489c2a1c9 in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16
    #2 0x7ae489c2a28a in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:360:3
    #3 0x58f66bb873b4 in _start (/workspace/umr+0x3c3b4) (BuildId: 272b661108c2d36eb7b35abae825e22f4dc875d8)

  Uninitialized value was created by an allocation of 'a' in the stack frame
    #0 0x58f66bc214c9 in main /workspace/umr.cpp:5:5

SUMMARY: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value /workspace/umr.cpp:7:9 in main
MemorySanitizer: 1 warnings reported.
```

## Conclusion
Effectively using MSan means the reliable elimination of false positives. This can only be achieved
if all of an application's dependencies including the standard C++ library are correctly
instrumented.
